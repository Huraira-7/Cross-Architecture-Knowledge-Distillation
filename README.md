# Cross-Architecture-Knowledge-Distillation

## Project Overview
Here is a brief project overview for a GitHub README:

This project addresses an error encountered when using the `llama3-70b-8192` language model in the `on_demand` service tier, which has a token limit of 6000 per minute. The error occurs when the requested token size exceeds this limit, and provides a solution to either reduce the message size or upgrade to the Dev Tier for more tokens. This project aims to resolve this rate limit exceeded error and ensure successful language model requests.

## Overview
This repository, Cross-Architecture-Knowledge-Distillation, contains the following summarized content based on the files analyzed:

### final_project/cifar_noisy_scrambled_dataset.ipynb
Here is a 3-5 sentence summary of the content:

The error messages indicate that the request size exceeds the limit of 6000 tokens per minute for the `llama3-70b-8192` model in the `on_demand` service tier. The requested token sizes range from 12541 to 12559, exceeding the limit. To resolve this, it is suggested to reduce the message size or upgrade to the Dev Tier.

### final_project/cifar_texture_bias_dataset.ipynb
Error creating final summary: Error code: 413 - {'error': {'message': 'Request too large for model `llama3-70b-8192` in organization `org_01jrs9kgpnfv698wasqg7gxpkp` service tier `on_demand` on tokens per minute (TPM): Limit 6000, Requested 6943, please reduce your message size and try again.

### final_project/final_report.pdf
Here is a concise summary:

The error occurs when trying to read a PDF file in Python because the `bytes` object lacks a `seek` attribute, necessary for file navigation. This implies the file is being treated as a byte stream rather than a file-like object, preventing proper access.

### final_project/resnet-to-vit.ipynb
I apologize, but the provided context does not match the summary you provided. The context appears to be an error message from a language model service, while the summary is describing a code evaluating the accuracy of two models on different datasets.

Here is a concise summary of the actual context:

The language model service returned an error code 413, indicating that the request is too large and exceeds the token limit of 6000 per minute. The requested token sizes range from 12541 to 12556, and the service suggests reducing the message size or upgrading to the Dev Tier for more tokens.

### final_project/shape_bias_slic_cifar_dataset.ipynb
Error creating final summary: Error code: 413 - {'error': {'message': 'Request too large for model `llama3-70b-8192` in organization `org_01jrs9kgpnfv698wasqg7gxpkp` service tier `on_demand` on tokens per minute (TPM): Limit 6000, Requested 6997, please reduce your message size and try again. Need more tokens? Upgrade to Dev Tier today at https://console.groq.com/settings/billing', 'type': 'tokens', 'code': 'rate_limit_exceeded'}}

### final_project/vit-to-resnet.ipynb
Here is a concise summary of the error messages:

The model `llama3-70b-8192` in organization `org_01jrs9kgpnfv698wasqg7gxpkp` has exceeded the token limit of 6000 tokens per minute (TPM) in the `on_demand` service tier. The requested tokens range from 10763 to 12564. To resolve this issue, reduce the message size or upgrade to the Dev Tier.
